The limestone formed approximately 340 million years ago during the Carboniferous period when this area was covered by a shallow tropical sea.&nbsp; Limestone is not the only feature of geological interest in the Burren. &nbsp;Huge sandstone boulders (glacial erratics) can be seen throughout the area. &nbsp;These were left behind by the massive glaciers as they crept across the region over 13,000 years ago. The Burren is a cultural landscape and demonstrates the interaction between people and the resources of the area in which they lived and worked over the millennia. &nbsp;About 2000-4500BC Neolithic farmers began to clear the native woodland (predominantly hazel, yew and juniper) from this area and began laying out field systems, building homes and great funereal monuments -&nbsp;megalithic tombs. &nbsp;The forest occupies 124ha and within it are in excess of 30 tombs dating from Neolithic times to the early bronze age, old field systems and some 19<sup>th</sup> century artefacts. &nbsp;Most of the present forest was planted in mid 1950’s and helped to protect the archaeological and geological features of the site. The Burren is located in&nbsp;Co Cavan close to the Fermanagh border in Northern Ireland and the Marble Arch Caves European Geopark. &nbsp;The forest area was part of a joint application by Cavan County Council and Fermanagh district council to UNESCO for expansion and geopark designation - <link http://www.europeangeoparks.org/ - external-link-new-window "Opens external link in new window">www.europeangeoparks.org</link>. &nbsp;This cross border application was successful with designation in 2008. &nbsp;It offers significant development potential for the region. Coillte will continue to manage the forest in line with its sustainable forest management principles. &nbsp;A management and bio diversity plan is in place.&nbsp; There are a network of roads and paths which offer scenic views of the surrounding landscape in addition to the archaeological and geological resources.

Walking in&nbsp;Guagán is an energetic undertaking but one can be assured that it is a rewarding experience. There are 6 different trails to whet the appetite of the walking enthusiast. These are of varying distances and degrees of difficulty. Each one has its own story to tell and show off the spectacular panoramas of mountain, valley, stream and lake.<br /><br />The park and surrounding countryside boasts a rich diversity of plant, animal and bird life. Ling heather and Moor grasses are abundant on the slopes while rock faces are sometimes covered with Mosses, Lichens and primitive plants. A rare plant called Fox’s Cabbage is to be found on rock faces near to mountain streams. This plant is one of the Hiberno-Lusitanian group whose distribution in Ireland is confined to small areas in the south west.<br /><br />Guagán is a place for all seasons. See it in the spring when the red tint of the larch lights up the grey autumnal landscape, or when winter hangs its icy stalactites from the cliffs below Maolach, or when evening sky casts its long shadows over the mountains. Above all experience it in the rain when “In deep valley’d Desmond&nbsp; a thousand wild fountains come down to that lake from their home in the mountains”.<br />These lines are taken from a poem on Guagán by J.J. Calanan who died in Lisbon in 1829. <b>PLEASE NOTE: </b>Coillte&nbsp;have installed an&nbsp;electronic pay barrier at the entrance to Guagán Barra Forest Park.&nbsp; The entrance fee is €5 (coins only).&nbsp; Alternatively, an annual admittance card may by purchased for €35 by contacting 087-1345097 or 026-20270.&nbsp; This admittance card is also available from Dineen\'s Centra Shop in Ballingeary Village and the Guagán Barra Hotel close to the entrance of the Park.', image: 'Valley_and_trees_gougane_01.JPG', trails_map: 'guagan_barra.pdf', os_map: '85', site_map_x: '', site_map_y: '', site_map_zoom: '30'  });

The southern section of the wood lies adjacent to Rostellan Lake;&nbsp; this lake is famed for its bird life and attracts large numbers of bird watchers all year round. Beautiful views of Cork Harbour can be seen from the Wood;&nbsp; to the west, Great Island can be seen and the historical town of Cobh also clearly visible.&nbsp; Looking to the south can be seen the ESB’s Aghada Electricity Generating Station, powered by gas it has a capacity of 540Mw.&nbsp; A little further south can be seen Whitegate Oil Refinery, which supplies up to 40% of Ireland’s fuel needs.&nbsp; Access to the wood is from the car park with&nbsp; walks of up to 1.5 km which are flat and easy and can be enjoyed by all ages – young and old. A great diversity of tree species can be seen e.g. oak, ash, beech, sycamore, Spanish chestnut, alder, birch, eucalyptus, Norway spruce, Sitka spruce, Scots pine, Japanese larch and Monterey pine. Other flora include hazel, holly, bramble ad a wide variety of plants associated with this woodland. Regeneration of the wood is ongoing and recent clearfelling of conifer areas have been replaced with broadleaves and native conifers. Fauna to be seen include the fox, rabbit, hare, stoat, badger and red squirrel. There is also a great variety of birdlife. History:<br />Rostellan wood was part of Rostellan Castle Estate.&nbsp; Rostellan Castle was demolished in 1920s. Rostellan Bridge, adjacent to wood, incorporates a rare example of a complex 18th. century milestone. There is also an 18th. century folly tower (partly in ruin) at the western point of wood on edge of seashore which was built by Lord Inchiquin in honour of the actress, Sarah Siddons, who was a famous actress in Drury Lane for 20 years during the latter part of the 18th. century. Another feature to be seen in the wood is an underground ice-house.&nbsp; These ice houses were the cold rooms of by-gone days which were apparently used for keeping meat and fish in storage over time.&nbsp; They were located close to lakes and ponds where ice could be collected and used in the cooling process for food preservation.&nbsp; Note: Opens all year round at 8.00 a.m.; closes at 6.00 p.m. winter and 10.00 p.m. summer.', image: 'Rostellan.jpg', trails_map: 'rostellan_alt_walk_siddons_tower.pdf', os_map: '81', site_map_x: '', site_map_y: '', site_map_zoom: '30'  });

This name may have its origins in the fact that the townland of Island lies between the river Dalua and one of its tributaries the Rampart stream.<br /><br />Island wood was once part of the Manor of Newmarket which was owned by Sir Richard Aldworth. Sir Richard’s grand nephew inherited the manor and married Elizabeth St Leger of Doneraile who was the only Freemason woman. Across the Dalua river from Island wood is Castlemcauliffe, home of the Mc Auliffes, Chieftains of Clanawley who owned all of the north western corner of Co Cork from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century.<br /><br />On arrival at the Island wood the visitor has the choice of taking the riverside walk by the footbridge or going right into the larger parking area and picnic site by the river. The river walk brings you along the bank of the Dalua passing magnificent oaks and some young Norway spruce interspersed with birch and sallies. It then&nbsp; enters a stand of mature Norway spruce with an understorey of ash, birch and alder which provides the perfect haven for wildlife. On passing a barrier and rounding a bend on the river you then enter a picnic site and car park. From here you can return by the forest road to the first car park, a round trip of 2 Km’s or you could be more adventurous and continue right up to Shrelane wood. On the way up you walk through young oak and ash saplings and then alongside a mature stand of beech on a steep slope to the river. Stop at the first road junction and take in the river and valley below with its oak woodland and lush green fields in the background. It was here that O’Sullivan Bere and his followers rested on the second night of their epic march to Leitrim in 1602.Further up the road is a “dry” bridge. This underpass was constructed to provide access for farm animals and machinery to the fields and the “Inches” by the river. This walk connects with the second car park and continues right up to Shrelane wood. Here is to be found Maolin’s cave. Maolin is reputed to be a daughter of the Mc Auliffe’s of Clanawley and was the goddess of fertility. Feile Luanasa was celebrated every year near Maolin’s cave in times past.<br />&nbsp;<br />This upper part of the wood is mainly mature broadleaf and conifer woodland, a perfect haven for bird, animal and plant life.<br /><br />As well as 4 ½ Km’s of forest road there is a further 3 km’s of forest track to whet the appetite of the keen walker.', image: '', trails_map: 'island_wood_river_walk.pdf', os_map: '72', site_map_x: '', site_map_y: '', site_map_zoom: '30'  });

No trip to Carrickgollogan would be complete however without visiting the viewing rock. It is worth the short climb up a moderately sloped footpath to the exposed rock outcrop where you&nbsp; will discover one of the most spectacular views of south Dublin and north Wicklow. Other features to be found in and around the woods are a Dolmen,&nbsp; the site of a Rath and a memorial to Nathaniel Alcock (1819 – 1904) erected by his daughters in 1914. <br />To find this memorial continue on past the car park to the junction of Murphy’s Lane and Ballyman Lane. At the junction there is an ESB pole. Enter the woods at this point and follow the path up the hill for approx 40m.

To reach it the visitor must step off the beaten track, travel up the valley and feel the remoteness of the mountains. Behind the trees the area abounds with streams, lakes, waterfalls and dramatic cliffs which characterise this untamed landscape. The wood is approached through a small grove of beech between the entrance and a bridge that spans the Owencashla river. Just over the bridge is a car park. The forest, typical of those which were established in the 1950’s and 60’s consists mainly of Sitka spruce and Lodgepole pine. However, there are some pockets of silver fir, larch and beech in the more sheltered areas and some native species such as birch, alder, and holly. As areas mature and are clearfelled much of the spruces are being replaced with larch, alder and Mountain ash in keeping with the primeval forests that once colonised the area. The first opportunity to experience the beauty of Glanteenassig is about&nbsp; 1.2 km from the car park. Just after crossing a wooden bridge, take a left along the trail to the shore of Lough Slat. This quiet and serene lake nestles below the imposing hill of Doon and the majestic rock face of Carrigaspanaig. This scene can be even more dramatic after heavy rain when “a thousand wild fountains rush down to that lake from their home in the mountains”. ( J,J, Callinan ). It is easy to understand the origin of the name Glanteenassig or Gleann&nbsp; Ti an Easaigh&nbsp; which translates to the Valley of the Waterfalls. Back to the forest road and take the trail to the right which leads the visitor up along the bank of the river Owencashla and back on to the road again. Continue along the road to a T junction, take a left and after 100 metres you are on the shores of Lough Caum with a board walk right around the lake. This lake is a trout angler’s paradise. From here the landscape opens up to a 360° vista of mountain, forest, lake and valley. Retrace your steps from here back to the T junction and continue on over a ford on the infant river travelling east for about 600 metres when suddenly the whole of Tralee bay with the Stack’s mountains in the background comes into view. <br />As well as the 3 waymarked trails there is about 8 km of forest road in this block of forest. This provides the ideal location for a long hike or for a family cycle.

This suggests that the area has been under forest for quite a long time. The 1st Edition Ordnance Survey map (1841-1846) shows part of the site covered by light woodland at this time (Garrett 2001), indicating a history of woodland cover over at least parts of the site.<br />&nbsp; This property comprises 810 ha. with the Loo river and valley running north east<br />through the middle of it. The wooded slopes come right down to the river from both sides. This was mainly native Sessile oak which became depleted in the early part of the 20th century. Restocking with mainly conifers took place in the 1940’s and 50’s.The wood now carries a mixture of broadleaves and conifers&nbsp; with Sitka spruce being the dominant species As well as the Loo river and the R569 road which dissects the valley, the old railway line from Kenmare to Headford junction ran right through the wood parallel to the river. This line is still in existence and makes for an enchanting walk through oak, birch and hazel scrub. The line which operated from 1891 closed in 1959. The focal point of Rossacroo is the Millennium forest site. This is an area of 40 ha. with Sessile oak in the valley bottom and lower slopes and a mixture of Oak and Scots pine, Sitka spruce and Lodgepole pine on the upper reaches. The long term vision here is to convert the entire area to Oak woodland through removal of the conifers and natural regeneration of the Oaks. There are 3 plots of millennium trees, Oak, Alder and Birch where one can go and visit their tree.<br />Across the road from the millennium forest is another car park and picnic facilities. The largest section of the forest is on this the northern side of the valley. There are 15 km of forest road in this block to whet the appetite of the walking enthusiast. As one ascends the hill vantage points are to be found here and there which open up the panorama of the valley below. For the really adventurous Crohane lake is to be found on the most northerly tip of the forest. A walk to this lake is not for the faint hearted and proper clothing and footwear is advised . The fauna of the area includes an expanding population of Sika deer which does untold damage to young trees, in particular to broadleaves. Our native Red deer are also to be found here. All of the regular forest inhabitants are to be found in Rossacroo such as foxes, badgers, hares, rabbits and a diverse population of birds.', image: '', trails_map: 'Rossacroo_Millennium_Forest_01.pdf', os_map: '79', site_map_x: '', site_map_y: '', site_map_zoom: '30'  });

The rivers converge just downstream from Lyracrumpane bridge.<br /><br />Lyracrumpane became famous in north Kerry and further a field for two reasons. The first was that in 1908 Matt Dillane from nearby Glountane&nbsp; while walking home from Listowel took a shortcut through “Quill’s mountain” a mile from his home. He sat for a rest and fell asleep. He “awoke” to the sound of men working in the bog, houses, horses and a railway track complete with engine and wagons. He told his story often and earnestly but naturally nobody believed him. Matt died some 16 or 17 years later and his story continued to be recalled around many a winter fireside. In 1938 Matt’s vision became a reality for the spot where he lay became the headquarters of the Lyracrumpane Bord na Mona works. There was an office, stores, a forge there and a diesel locomotive with 14 wagons brought turf from the bog to the roadside for waiting lorries. From 1938 to 1963 some 250,000 tons of peat was produced from this bog. A mural of Matt’s vision painted by local man John Joe Sheehy now stands at the car park and picnic site.<br /><br />The second reason for Lyracrumpane’s fame is that at nearby Reanagowan crossroads Dan Paddy Andy O Sullivan a famed matchmaker ran a dancehall and matched up many a couple. Dan Paddy Andy was the subject of John B Keane’s book “The Man with the Triple Name”<br /><br />Folklore also states that Fionn Mac Cumhaill, chief of Na Fianna&nbsp; fell to his death&nbsp; in the Stack’s mountains and is buried in Lyracrumpane.<br /><br />The total area of Coillte’s woodland in Lyracrumpane is 574 ha. The Smearlagh river which means the river of the blackberries flows right through the property. A looped&nbsp; walk has been developed along the river bank and back by the public road which is called the Mass Path/ River Walk. A car park and picnic site is to be found along the loop walk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The area adjacent to the river is around 100ha. Some of this was planted in 1968 while the area closest to the river was planted in 1992.Tree species is mainly Sitka spruce but there are a few excellent stands of ash and beech near the river.

The walk to the top of the rath will involve an ascent of 50 metres, but is well worth it.&nbsp; Some of the walks are quite steep and not all the tracks are gravelled so bring appropriate footwear to suit the terrain.<br />Mullaghreelan wood is an old woodland site and has a rich diversity of flora and fauna. There is a wide range of tree species including oak, ash, beech, spruce, pine and firs. The vegetation is typical of all old woodland estates and includes bluebells, buttercups, lords and ladies, holly, ivy and ferns.

The area is very remote and offers the visitor peace and tranquillity. The only sounds to be heard are the crash of the waterfalls and the fast flowing Barrow. <br />The area has four way-marked marked trails.

The area was extensively quarried back in the 1800’s. In fact the river was more than likely diverted at one stage in order to quarry the sandstone. There are still many signs of the quarrying activities evident today, no more so than the exposed bedrock of the red sandstone and the holes where explosives were placed. The Clamp Hole Waterfall is a good example of the waterfalls that occur in the area.<br />The valley which the Barrow flows through is a good example of a glacial moraine. The Barrow has cut it’s way through it and hence the steep slopes of gravel are evident on the sides of the valleys. Sometimes these slopes collapse and expose the gravel underneath. Due to the make up of the geology, Glenbarrow has a wide diversity of plants. Apart from the usual forest plant species such as ferns, mosses, heathers, shrubs there are many orchids on the slopes of the valleys. The area is also very rich with animal life.

The arch is quite impressive when viewed from below on the riverside walk, being 10 m high from the river bed.<br /><br />The Glen river is a “young” river in geological terms. Mountain streams such as this tend to cut out straight paths and will eventually do so irrespective of whatever natural obstacle may lie in its way.

There are three way marked trails in the forest, the Tain Trail, the Ring of Gullion and the short but interesting Ravensdale Loop. The forest is rich in archaeological features such as the standing stones just a short detour off the Ravensdale Loop and has many interesting features such as bridges and old driving roads. The forest is varied with many species including larch, Douglas fir, large beech and oak and of course Sitka spruce. With clear felling and re-planting the area has developed a broad range of forest types which add to its overall biodiversity and aesthetic appeal. The Tain Trail – named for the legendary Bull of Cooley enters the forest at the southern end of the forest near Curralhir Bridge and follows forest roads and tracks to continue over the mountains into Omeath on Carlingford Lough. This national way marked trail is marked with the yellow walking man sign and offers a strenuous climb to the summit of approximately 2 – 3 hrs. However the walker will be rewarded with magnificent views. The Táin – TÁIN BÓ CULAINE – is the legendary tale of the attempted theft by Queen Maedbh of Connacht of the Brown Bull of Cooley and the exploits of Cúchulainn the Ulster hero to protect the Bull and Ulster from her armies. A second trail – the Ring of Gullion – leaves from the car park and heads up the Ravensdale Loop trail and then follows the river before turning north towards the border with county Armagh where it continues on across the slopes of Clermont Hill. The final trail is the short but interesting Ravendsale Loop.

But what is present today is the result of a long and interesting history beginning with the retreat of the glaciers from Ireland about 10,000 years ago.&nbsp; After the glaciers retreated, Ireland would have been a tundra-like landscape(with large lakes in the midlands) which slowly became afforested.&nbsp; All of the present agricultural land would have been densely forested with a mix of native broadleaved trees – Birch, Hazel, Pine, Oak, Elm, Alder and Ash.&nbsp; The earliest farmers of the Neolithic period (4000 – 2000 BC) began felling the forests and clearing land to plant crops and graze domestic animals. Forest clearance for farming and to supply timber for ships, cathedrals and even iron-smelting continued until the early 18<sup>th</sup> century, by which time most of the forest in Ireland had been cleared.&nbsp; However, with the development of the large estates began a process of planting trees – Littlewood is a good example, being planted by the Slane estate sometime before 1840.&nbsp; Most of the trees planted were broadleaved, primarily oak which was such a valuable building timber – large stumps of oak are common throughout the forest. However other types, non-native tree species were planted including Beech, Horse Chestnut, Sitka Spruce (from North America) and Hornbeam.&nbsp; The State Forest Service bought Littlewood from the Earl of Mountcharles in 1963.&nbsp; All the large oak were felled for commercial use and the area was replanted with a variety of species but dominantly with exotic, fast growing coniferous tree species.&nbsp; Subsequently, Coillte, the present owners, have managed Littlewood by combining replanting with conifers but also allowing broadleaved species to mature and dominate in some areas of the forest. This management has allowed the woodland flora and fauna to continue and contributes to great biodiversity that persists throughout Littlewood today.', image: '', trails_map: 'littlewood_map.pdf', os_map: '43', site_map_x: '', site_map_y: '', site_map_zoom: '15'  });

The forest is on both sides of the Camcor River valley and spans large blocks of coniferous forest. The valley was heavily afforested by the state during the 1950s and 1960s. There is a diversity of tree species present in Glenregan but the most striking feature of the area is the patchwork of age structures which gives the forest a unique texture. The area also has mature stands of Sitka spruce which are over 30 metres in height. This shows the excellent productivity of this area in terms of timber production. The forest envelopes both sides of the Camcor valley and offers great views over the valley onto west Offaly and the River Shannon. The walks and trails in this area are through mountainous terrain and can feel quite remote despite being reasonably close to the R440. There is an extensive network of forest roads for walking and trekking. The Slieve Bloom Way goes through the car-park and can be easily accessed from this point. It runs west to Castle Bernard (Kinnitty) and eastwards to Cadamstown from this point. There is a wide diversity of flora and fauna. The main animal species are fallow deer, hare, fox, badger and many bird species. The flora is very typical of most upland forestry areas. There are mosses, ferns, bracken, briars, heather, bilberry and many scrub species present. The main tree species in the area is Sitka spruce, which is the main commercial timber species in Ireland.

Some of the Oak stands are “seed stands” which means that acorns (seed) collected from them are used to grow transplants which are replanted in suitable sites throughout the country to replace conifers and extend our Native Woodland. There&nbsp; is also a stand of old Yew trees and this is also being developed and extended by removing non-native species and replanting with transplants from seed collected from the existing trees.<br />The Swiss Cottage is a very popular tourist attraction and along with Cahir Castle in the town,&nbsp; gets many thousands of visitors each year.

It is mainly a coniferous forest with Sitka Spruce being the main species. Other conifer species are Scots Pine, Japanese Larch, Douglas Fir, Norway Spruce, Western Hemlock and Western Red Cedar. The area also contains approximately 50 Hectares of native Oak, Birch and Alder. Animals present include fallow deer, foxes, badgers, hares and red squirrels. Birds include pheasants, hawks, kestrels, ravens, herons and many song birds. Glengarra property was formerly part of the Shanbally Estate, between Burncourt and Clogheen, which was owned by Viscount Lismore. During the 19<sup>th</sup> century he built a lodge ( which is now An Óige youth hostel ) about 3 kms up from the main road. He planted the area along the river and road leading to the lodge with many native and exotic trees. Some of those that are still present are Cedars of Lebanon, Sequoiadendron, spruces, pines, Laurel and a variety of arboreal Rhododendron. The car park and picnic site area is very conveniently located near the entrance to the wood. It is located beside the river and a new footbridge has been erected to give access to other parts of the forest, including the Millennium Forest Project. A number of these projects were developed countrywide in the year 2000 as part of a government initiative to plant one native tree for every household in Ireland. This project here is 15 hectares in size and contains approximately 60,000 trees, mainly Oak with some Birch, Alder and Scots Pine as well. There are two waymarked trails on this site. A 2km loop walk starts at the car park and is waymarked in red. It goes across the river and through many different stands of trees, back over the river again, down a forest road, in through more forest before ending back at the car park. The Millennium Walk which is about 7 kms long commences at the top of the car park and is signposted by stakes with a green arrow and Oak leaf on them. There is a small car park about 1 km up the road to the An Óige Hostel&nbsp; which contains signage and information on the Millennium Forest. It stretches from about 120 metres to about 300 metres above sea level and there are a number of viewing points looking south to the lowlands and the Knockmealdown Mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Note: From the top of the Millennium trail, there is a mountain access route to Galtymore Mountain.

Shadowed by the mighty Lugnaquillia (927m) its inhospitable terrain provided safe haven for rebels like Fiach McHugh O’Byrne who in 1580 defeated 800 English soldiers in the Battle of Glenmalure having waited in ambush in the trees of Ballinafunshoge. The nearby disused lead mine opened between 1797 and 1800, during the period of the 1798 rebellion, it was one of the last places in which the rebellion was eventually suppressed.&nbsp; It operated until 1864 producing up to 400 tons of lead ore per year. A very important aspect of mining exploration was the use of timbers to support the tunnels. The shafts and tunnels needed to be propped up as the miners worked their way into the mountain. In the 1850s and 60s The Mining Company of Ireland planted over a million trees in the Glendalough Valley for use as timber props in the mine. This was also a commercial venture for the Company as some of the timber was sold on the open market, adding to the company profits.&nbsp; Today the forest species include Scots Pine and Larch. There are two waymarked trails at Ballinafunshoge, the Miner’s Path and the Wicklow Way.', image: 'ballinafuinshogue.jpg', trails_map: 'Ballinafunshoge_forest.pdf', os_map: '56', site_map_x: '', site_map_y: '', site_map_zoom: '30'  });

Powerscourt Estate documents reveal that the name Crone was in use as far back as 1757 and may derive from Cruasdhne or hard ground. This area became a hideout following the 1798 rebellion for bands of rebels and insurgents. The British Military built the Military Road with a barracks at the top of the valley to “open” up the area following the ’98 rising. During the ensuing centuries the value of the oak in the area was recognised and the woodland exploited for timber. Today the forest is sustainably managed to produce quality saw log and tree species include Scots pine, Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, Larch and Corsican pine. The forest is home to a variety of animals including deer, foxes, badgers and red squirrels. Walking and Hiking in Crone<br />The forest has an extensive network of forest roads and trails which can take the walker either along the very popular Wicklow Way to the magnificent viewpoint at Ride Rock looking over the Powerscourt Waterfall and the Great Sugar Loaf or through the quieter reaches of the forest on the Maulin Mountain Trail or on the forest roads to Ballyreagh and Ravens Glen.

While there are no waymarked trails here, the forest road network does provide up to six kilometres of walking trails, sections of which will offer the hiker a moderately challenging walk. As this is a commercial forest site, the main tree species to be seen include Sitka spruce, Japanese larch Lodgepole pine and Douglas fir. There are also some small areas of oak, beech, poplar and ash. Because of the uneven aged woodland, the area is a haven for wildlife and you may see foxes, rabbits, badgers and squirrels as you make your way along the forest roads. The hill itself rises to 240 metres above sea level providing the walker with some breath taking views of the coastline. On a clear day, it&nbsp; is possible to see the Welsh coastline in the distance. Closer to home, it is possible to see the wind turbines situated on the Arklow Sand Bank which lies 10 kilometres off the coast of Arklow. This was the worlds first project to deploy wind turbines in excess of 3 megawatts. The project represents Irelands first offshore wind power project, and is expected to generate enough energy to serve&nbsp; the annual electricity&nbsp; needs of about 16,000 households. Also visible to the south, is the town of Arklow and, further south, Tara Hill in Co.Wexford.', image: '', trails_map: 'ballymoyle_hill.pdf', os_map: '62', site_map_x: '', site_map_y: '', site_map_zoom: '30'  });
